#### About this project: 
Another playground porject where the goal is just to get comfortable with different libraries. This is an app that's connected to the Google books API. 
As of right now it only has a very simple search function that you can use to get a list of matching titles. The functionalities will shortly be expanded.

#### Technologies used: 
* **React.js** for making the nice UI.
* **Redux** for state and data handling.
* **Bootstrap** for keeping the design in place.
* **CSS 3** for small design fixes.

3. npm install
